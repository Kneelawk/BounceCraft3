# BounceCraft3

[Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/bouncecraft3)

BounceCraft adds pads and grates that move entities and the player around, potentially very quickly. All of this is
based around a new resource, called Bouncium, that generates in lakes around the world.

# History

Back in Minecraft 1.2.5, I was learning how to make mods (and learning Java at the same time), and I created a mod that
added a single block. This block, when stepped-on, would fling whatever stepped on it into the air. This was the first
version of BounceCraft.

Later, in 1.5.2, I decided to completely re-design the mod, adding bounce pads, speed pads, grates, bouncium blocks, and
connected-texture glass (yes, using the 47 texture method). This was the first version that resembled what we have
today.

Then, in 1.7.10, I decided to add multipart functionality, allowing pads and grates to be placed in the same block. This
version was called BounceCraft2, because it involved a whole re-write.

Now, in Minecraft 1.20, I am working to port each of the features from the 1.5.2 and 1.7.10 versions of the mod, with
some modifications for balance and style.
